                  They have all of the necessary mounting bolts for cargo racks
                   and fenders, and although they still have a drop handlebar,
                   they usually have a more relaxed frame design so that the rider
                   is more upright, for more comfort when riding long distances
                   for multiple days at a time. They have a lower gear range
                   compared to regular road bikes, to allow for carrying heavy
                    loads up steep hills. They also make good commuter bicycles,
